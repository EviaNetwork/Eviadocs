# Non-Custodial Staking

Non-custodial staking, as the name suggests means that custody of the funds is **NOT** taken in order to claim or stake them. **Non-custodial staking is evidently the better way to go as the funds are not transferred to another account.**

A _**non-custodial solution**_ allows users to retain control over their assets while using the services provided by the protocol. In a non-custodial solution, the user owns their private keys, which are used to access their assets on the blockchain. This means that users don't have to rely on a third party to hold onto their assets.

The benefits of non-custodial solutions in DeFi is they provide users with greater control over their assets, reduce the risk of hacking and fraud, and offer greater transparency and efficiency than traditional financial institutions.
