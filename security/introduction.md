We have implemented an authorization (authz) grants system. This system enables you to define and manage access privileges for different actions within the platform. You have the flexibility to grant specific permissions while maintaining control over your assets. This ensures that only authorized party can perform critical actions, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of your funds.

Our team of experience developers adheres to best practices in security and follows industry standards to safeguard your assets. We regularly conduct security audits and assessments internally to identify and address any vulnerabilities or potential threats. Our team also continuously monitors the platform for any suspicious activities or anomalies, taking prompt action to ensure the integrity of the assets.
