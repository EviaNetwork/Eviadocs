# Story for starting EVIA

Once upon a time, _Professor, Rocky & Max_ were traveling through the vast expanse of the cosmos ecosystem in their spaceship. They had been exploring different blockchain projects and discussing the current state of DeFi in the ecosystem. They realized that the DeFi landscape was still in its infancy, and there was much work to be done to make it more accessible, user-friendly, secure, and profitable for traders and investors.

It was at that moment that the Professor took a pledge to do something about it. He felt a deep sense of responsibility to contribute to the growth and development of DeFi, and his companions were eager to join him in this mission.

As they continued their journey, their spaceship suddenly got hit by a living organism. They were amazed by its beauty and complexity and soon discovered that it was a new form of life they had never seen before. They named it Evia, after the goddess of the hunt, and were inspired by its resilience and adaptability.

In that moment, they realized that they had found their calling - to create a super-app that was as resilient and adaptable as Evia, one that could weather the ups and downs of the DeFi market and emerge stronger and more profitable than ever before. With that vision in mind, they set out to create the _EVIA Foundation_.

Their _**goal**_ is to build DeFi products that would generate wealth for all stakeholders, from the everyday investor to the experienced trader, also Evia platforms UI/UX will set a new standard for simplicity and elegance.

Imagine a world where decentralized finance becomes accessible and profitable for all. That's precisely the goal of Evia, to build DeFi products that would generate wealth for all stakeholders, from the everyday investor to the experienced trader.
