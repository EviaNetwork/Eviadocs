# APR vs APY

_APR and APY_ are both important measures of the yield or return on investment. While they are related, they are not the same thing, and understanding the difference between them is crucial for making informed investment decisions.

APR represents the cost of borrowing or the return on investment, expressed as a yearly interest rate. It includes interest, fees, and other costs associated with a loan or financial product.
