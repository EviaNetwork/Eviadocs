# Overview

Creating a groundbreaking product in the ecosystem often requires numerous attempts and trial-and-error iterations. Evia is following a similar trajectory, planning to introduce its products in several phases.

In every ecosystem, such as the Cosmos ecosystem, there are various tokens, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Borrowing/lending platforms (B/L), and tools. However, it can be challenging for users to navigate and identify the optimal wealth-building strategy, often resulting in more losses than gains.&#x20;

Now, envision a product where all aspects related to yields converge, offering users a comprehensive super-app to efficiently manage and track all strategies within the ecosystem. That's EVIA for you!

Evia aims to consolidate and optimize such products, unlocking superior yield optimization strategies wherever feasible.&#x20;

**As the initial version (v1) of the product, we have structured it into three distinct phases:**

[Phase 1](phase-1.md): Auto-compounding vaults

[Phase 2](phase-2.md): Yield Tokenisations

[Phase 3](phase-3.md): Small Cases
