CosmoDash is a stats aggregator dashboard, which trackers APRs for all the [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools?) Pools & [Sovereign chain](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/tokens) Tokens.&#x20;

It provides real-time data and analytics on the chains, latest pool returns, trading volumes, and liquidity across the pools, giving you the power to make informed trading decisions and maximize your returns.

## Scoring Methodology

For all the Sovereign chains, CosmoDash provide a Score (a.k.a Evia Score). This score evaluates chains/products to produce an overarching security score based on transparency and adherence to best practices.

{% hint style="success" %}
Evia‚Äôs Process Quality Reviews (PQRs) follow a clear, standarised and established process, allowing users to directly compare scores across different projects.
{% endhint %}

Evia‚Äôs PQRs allow users to make informed decisions about the protocols they invest in, and provide developers with clear, achievable goals towards improving code, documentation and transparency.

**Note:** Cosmodash does not perform code audits. Instead, it only reviews the quality of process and documentation behind the code, of which audits are only a part.
