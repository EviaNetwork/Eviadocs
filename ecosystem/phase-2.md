# Phase 2

In the ever-changing world of assets, where prices can soar or plummet in the blink of an eye, Evia Propel can ensure you never miss out on maximizing your yield potential. Whether it's a bull market brimming with opportunities or a bear market that has you on edge, we've got you covered.

_**Picture this:**_ In a bull market, where asset values are skyrocketing, Evia Propel empowers you to increase your yield exposure, harnessing the upward momentum and riding the wave of profitability. But what about those dreaded bear markets, where yields take a nosedive?&#x20;

Fear not, with _**Evia Propel**_, you can effectively hedge against yield downturns, safeguarding your earnings even in the most challenging times.

The platform we are designing has specific features that enable traders to create separate tokens for their original asset and their future yield asset to optimize flexibility and profitability. By having distinct tokens that represent both the underlying asset and the future yield it holds, you can navigate the market with agility and seize every opportunity that comes your way.

We're taking inspiration from traditional finance's interest rate derivatives and injecting their power into the heart of DeFi. We firmly believe that yield tokens will play a pivotal role in establishing efficient money markets in the decentralized world. With Evia Propel, we strip the yield out from yield-bearing tokens and generate unique tokens that act as your personal claim on future yield. **It's a game-changer that empowers you to make calculated moves, driven by the certainty of anticipated returns**.

But that's not all, these tokens can then be traded on Evia propel AMM, allowing traders to speculate, hedge, or arbitrage against fluctuations in yield.

Our AMM will be designed to optimize yield opportunities and specially designed to solve time decay problem in yield trading, ensuring that you can trade yield tokens efficiently and effectively.&#x20;

Stay tuned for more detailed updates as we unveil the full potential of Evia Propel. The future of yield maximization awaits, and we're here to propel you towards it.
