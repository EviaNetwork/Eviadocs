# Risks

No risk is involved as Evia Vault is the non-custodial solution, offering zero risk and full ownership of your assets.

{% hint style="success" %}
Evia Vault only gets an Authz Grant to generate profits for the delegator. At no point are the funds in a Evia owned wallet. The claimed rewards are accumulated in the delegator's wallet and the investment for compounding is done from that account itself.
{% endhint %}

We manage your wallet on your behalf, so you can sit back, relax, and watch your portfolio grow!

**However few points needs to be taken care of while dealing with non custodial solution**

* If users lose their private keys, then you may lose access to their assets permanently.
* By using a spam website impersonating EVIA. Always verify URL before connecting your wallet.
